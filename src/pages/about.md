# About Me
---

I started programming for the first time when I was 13 creating Minecraft Mod's in Java after crudely learning the language from [Buckys's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@thenewboston/videos). This led me down the game development rabbit hole, exploring as many different ways to create games as I could find, including attempts in Unity, Java, OpenGL, Ogre3D / SFML in C++. Some of these old relics are still available on my GitHub, such as [my incredibly straightforward pong clone](https://github.com/maguirekrist/SFML-Pong2D) (I didn't say I was original). 

During High School, I was the president of the Programming Club for my junior and senior years. This allowed me to share my passion with other students, and one of my first workshops was teaching web development with Ruby on Rails. In hindsight, this was a complete mistake, as it turned out that not many 14-17-year-olds really cared about MVC web apps. We should have just done programming in PyGame or something like that, a suggestion for any other presidents out there.

I studied at [Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu/), graduating with two bachelor's degrees, a B.A in Psychology and a B.S in Computer Science. During my studies, I participated in several hackathons and was a member of the Google Developer Student Club. During this time, I also paid for my education almost completely via freelancing, working on several contracted applications to help pay for my education and sharpen my skills.

In 2023, I moved to NYC and am currently a Software Developer at Debevoise & Plimpton. 

Nowadays, I'm geeking out over systems programming and am interested in databases, observability, and cloud infrastructure. In my free time, I'm studying C++ and Rust in hopes of contributing to open-source low-level software projects.
